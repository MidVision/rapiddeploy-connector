# RapidDeploy Connector
This project provides a _Java API_ to connect and execute certain _RapidDeploy_ features.

To use this library from a _Maven_ project:

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.midvision.plugins</groupId>
	<artifactId>rapiddeploy-connector</artifactId>
	<version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Make sure the version you want to use coincide with one of the releases available.

And the public repository where it can be found:

```xml
<repository>
	<id>MidVision</id>
	<url>http://www.download.midvision.com/content/repositories/Community_release/</url>
</repository>
```

It is a self-contained library that includes all its needed dependencies so it can be used as an only _JAR_ dependency file.
